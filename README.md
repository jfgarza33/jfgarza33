## Hi there, I'm Jesse 👋
I'm a higher-education project manager who channels creativity into learning and building. Lately I've been diving deep into data engineering, Python, software and web development, and the broader JavaScript ecosystem so I can connect people, ideas, and technology more effectively.

- 🔭 I’m energized by front-end development, AI, large language models, machine learning, and data-focused storytelling.
- 🌱 I’m steadily leveling up my GitHub workflow while sharpening my SQL and Python fundamentals.
- 🤔 I’m always curious about new LLM techniques, approachable learning resources, and practical ways to turn imaginative ideas into reality.
- 👯 I love teaming up on open-source experiments, creative collaborations, and personal passion projects.
- 📫 If you’re interested in collaborating, mentoring, or swapping creative strategies, feel free to open an issue or reach out on social media.
